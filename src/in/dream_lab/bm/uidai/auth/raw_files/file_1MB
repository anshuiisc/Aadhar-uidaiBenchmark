have a situation where I need to know the size of a String/encoding pair, in bytes, but cannot use the getBytes() method because 1) the String is very large and duplicating the String in a byte[] array would use a large amount of memory, but more to the point 2) getBytes() allocates a byte[] array based on the length of the String * the maximum possible bytes per character. So if I have a String with 1.5B characters and UTF-16 encoding, getBytes() will try to allocate a 3GB array and fail, since arrays are limited to 2^32 - X bytes (X is Java version specific).
